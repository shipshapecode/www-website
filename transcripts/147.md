â€‹[00:00:00] 

[00:00:05] **Robbie:** What's going on everybody? Welcome to Whiskey Web and whatnot with your host Robbie the Wagner, and Charles, William Carpenter, the second with another Robbie. Robbie Russell, what's going on, Robbie?

[00:00:17] **Robby Russell:** on. Robbie. Hi there. Thanks for having me.

[00:00:19] **Robbie:** Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for being on. I was just skipping right over where I called Charles the second, not giving him a chance to respond.

Uh

[00:00:28] **Charles:** Yeah,

[00:00:29] **Robby Russell:** quick, quick question. Is Charles, are you actually the third?

[00:00:32] **Charles:** I am. Yeah.

[00:00:33] **Robby Russell:** as well. So we have got, we have both have connections there.

[00:00:36] **Charles:** yes.

[00:00:37] **Robby Russell:** will not be a fourth, um.

[00:00:39] **Charles:** yeah. Uh,

[00:00:40] **Robbie:** That seems to be a theme.

[00:00:42] **Charles:** yeah, I, I did make people. I chose not to do a fourth. I, um, I was like, this is where it ends.

[00:00:49] **Robby Russell:** I vividly remember having, uh, a family dinner with my grandfather and my dad there. It was like several of my relatives when I was maybe 13 or so. [00:01:00] And I remember, I think there was a question, something came up like, oh, will you name your kid the fourth? And I was like, no, I will not. And I just, there was like a, like a slight look of disappointment.

And then, but then I also just decided not to make kids, or not to make, make people. So I got outta that regardless. So I'm a much better uncle anyways. But no, I'm, I, I, the, the lineage of our royalty has, has ended with me.

a

[00:01:29] **Robbie:** Yeah.



[00:01:33] **Charles:** Anyway.

[00:01:35] **Robby Russell:** were that great anyways. All right.

[00:01:37] **Charles:** Whoa. Say maybe you should be a host on this show. You're, yeah, you're self-Deprecating humor is right on par. This is gonna go fine. So there's two Robbie's and two trays is what I was gonna say. 

[00:01:47] **Robbie:** Robbie, you should have at least a few sentences about who you are before we totally skip over letting you, uh, introduce yourself.

[00:01:54] **Robby Russell:** who, who am I? That's a good question. I am Robbie Russell. I am [00:02:00] a software engineer. I've been running a software agency in, I live in Portland, Oregon. I've been doing that since 2002, so that's like 22 years or so. And primarily work in Ruby on Rails.

And I created an open source project called oh My Z Shell nearly 15 years ago, which is where some people know me from

[00:02:18] **Charles:** Mm-Hmm.

[00:02:19] **Robby Russell:** and me, yeah. Blogger and podcast host of the Maintainable Software podcast.

[00:02:25] **Robbie:** Cool.

[00:02:26] **Charles:** Very

[00:02:27] **Robbie:** All right. Now you can intro the

[00:02:30] **Charles:** I may Well,

[00:02:30] **Robbie:** Yes, you may. I gave you permission.

[00:02:33] **Charles:** Uh, thank you young man. 


## Whiskey Tasting: Mortlach &quot;The Wee Witchie&quot; 12 Years Single Malt Scotch Whisky

[00:02:35] **Charles:** Okay, so today we're having. The Mortlock, I don't know if I'm saying this right, but it's in Mortlock, single malt whiskey, scotch whiskey. The we witchy is what it is. It's aged 12 years. Uh, we know it's single malt, so we know the mash bill.

It is aged in sherry and bourbon casks and it is 86.8 proof. The, the wewe. I [00:03:00] might say that a bunch. I'm sorry. The Wewe.

[00:03:02] **Robby Russell:** had not heard of this one before

[00:03:04] **Charles:** Yeah. Me either.

[00:03:05] **Robbie:** Yeah, this was a purchase solely on the branding because it looked very cool. I like their fonts and logo and stuff, so

[00:03:12] **Charles:** Hmm. Looks like a fancy coworking space or something called the Mor Luck.

[00:03:17] **Robbie:** I'd work there.

[00:03:19] **Robby Russell:** How do you pronounce? Is it imported from Norwalk, Connecticut, but Dufftown, Scotland. I don't know where that is in the, the, maybe I'll pull up a map later.

[00:03:29] **Charles:** It's the beast of Dufftown too. And that is also very compelling. On the top, near the, the Cork, it says the beast of Dufftown.

[00:03:37] **Robbie:** An ode to the still that bears the beast of Def Town. I guess that's what they called the still.

[00:03:42] **Charles:** Uh, an ode to the still. Yeah. I don't know. It must

[00:03:46] **Robbie:** not be working anymore. I don't know.

[00:03:49] **Charles:** Ooh. It's got kind of a sweet smell with sherry casks and bourbon probably would

[00:03:54] **Robbie:** Hmm. Yeah.

[00:03:55] **Charles:** We get almost like a little bit of a

[00:03:57] **Robbie:** how about some dried [00:04:00] apricot?

[00:04:00] **Charles:** No. Uh, raspberries. Dried raspberries.

[00:04:03] **Robbie:** No, I, I was actually thinking raisins. Raisins kind of,

[00:04:07] **Robby Russell:** I was thinking moist C currents

[00:04:09] **Charles:** okay. I

[00:04:10] **Robbie:** non dried.

[00:04:11] **Robby Russell:** not dried, not dried,

[00:04:12] **Charles:** moist. Yeah. I almost said, uh, cherries actually. Yeah. So that was, it was vacillating there. Alright, let's find out. You might have influenced me a little bit, but I get kind of like a sour cherry, so very moist, sour cherry. Get a little of that, a little mustiness to it.

[00:04:37] **Robby Russell:** How

[00:04:38] **Charles:** kind of mild though. Hmm?

[00:04:41] **Robbie:** Mossies.

[00:04:43] **Charles:** Yeah. Ma, ma. Oh, Seno. Masano.

[00:04:48] **Robbie:** Mossimo, like the, the target close.

[00:04:50] **Charles:** Mamo. No, ma. Oh yeah. Uh, Masano is what my son used to call marshmallows before he can say words. Good. Um, Maness would be, [00:05:00] it has kind of like a leafy earthiness to it and almost like, almost like a little bit of, um, not dewy, but like, yeah, I,

[00:05:12] **Robbie:** like you went outside in the morning and just licked your lawn.

[00:05:15] **Charles:** yeah, maybe. Yeah. I.

[00:05:18] **Robby Russell:** and like someone had, uh, maybe dropped or put out a custom put out their cigarette in the grass or there's some a, there's some tobacco e vibes in there.

[00:05:29] **Charles:** Interesting. Yeah. And then you licked it. Mine would have a lot of dirt. I do have grass, but, um, there's, there's a decent amount of dirt.

[00:05:37] **Robby Russell:** like a smoky or charred, burnt toffee. Just like a little too cooked.

[00:05:44] **Charles:** Hmm. Maybe charred moss for me is where I'm going with it. Hmm. I get a little, the toffee though, after the sour kind of fades and a little toffee and then it gets into this [00:06:00] like something kind of mildewy almost. It sounds delicious,

[00:06:06] **Robbie:** selling this one.

[00:06:07] **Charles:** Yeah. Well this is the beast of dufftown. It's not for the lighthearted.

Okay. No, it, it might be a wee witchy could, could be a bit

[00:06:14] **Robbie:** it too late for me to change my handle to the beast of deaf Town? Sounds pretty cool.

[00:06:20] **Charles:** You, you're the beast of flu. You are the beast of Fluff town.

[00:06:25] **Robby Russell:** the third.

[00:06:26] **Charles:** Beastie the third, the we witch eat the third. That's what I would get.

[00:06:31] **Robby Russell:** Hmm.

[00:06:32] **Charles:** Okay. Yeah.

[00:06:34] **Robby Russell:** Interesting. I, I like it.

[00:06:37] **Charles:** Robert Wagner, would you feel prepared to give this a rating? So Robbie, I will tell you and our other listener, uh, just a little reminder on our rating system, zero to eight tentacles because we are pseudo engineers. So of course we have to include the zero, uh, four being like middle of the road for you, not bad, eight being amazing.

Give me nothing else [00:07:00] basically. Um,

[00:07:02] **Robby Russell:** Yeah.

[00:07:02] **Robbie:** for me it's gonna be, I'm gonna say a five 'cause it's a little better than middle of the road. I think I've had a lot worse scotches for sure. Um, yeah, I don't know. Nothing like, it's kind of middle of the road, but it's like not in a bad way. So it's like I'm giving it that one extra point.

[00:07:24] **Robby Russell:** point.

[00:07:24] **Charles:** Yeah. Interesting. Robbie Russell.

[00:07:27] **Robby Russell:** Yeah. I'm gonna, I'm gonna second that. I feel like it's a five. a, it's a solid five. If it feels, it's something I can drink and I wouldn't like, turn it down. If someone was offering it to me, um, would I buy another bottle? I don't know. Maybe.

[00:07:45] **Charles:** Yeah. Yeah. I'm kind of, I think I'm gonna go four and a half. I was leaning more for, I mean, uh,

[00:07:51] **Robby Russell:** we can use halves. Oh,

[00:07:52] **Charles:** Yeah. Oh yeah. We could do whatever we want. There's no, like,

[00:07:54] **Robby Russell:** 0.2.

[00:07:55] **Charles:** all right, perfect. There you go. A little, a little above. Uh, you have to get the closest without [00:08:00] going over. Um, so yeah, for me it's like easy to drink.

It's pretty smooth. It has some interesting flavors, but it fades away really quickly. It's like, quick to forget. Doesn't have much

[00:08:12] **Robby Russell:** No, that's true.

[00:08:13] **Charles:** Yeah. And so, you know, it, it's a little too, we, I would like more we in my witchy is what I

[00:08:20] **Robby Russell:** We, we,

[00:08:21] **Charles:** we, we wewe ah, wewe, not scotch at all in that way or that not a scotch, uh, s Scottish accent.

[00:08:30] **Robby Russell:** My suspicion is that my wife will use this in experimenting with some cocktails, so we'll see how that, I'll like, I'll report back on that.

That was her, uh, pandemic

hobby that she picked up over the last several years. She's amazing at making cocktails now, which is wonderful.

[00:08:45] **Charles:** That's a nice, nice skill to have in the house. I was gonna say, other than the rusty nail, I can't say I've really had many, like scotch based cocktails. I think this could be interesting for that though. 

[00:08:55] **Robbie:** You know what else is interesting

[00:08:57] **Charles:** Hmm.

[00:08:58] **Robbie:** type script

[00:08:59] **Charles:** [00:09:00] Is it though.

[00:09:01] **Robbie:** depending on who you ask.

[00:09:02] **Charles:** Yeah. You know what's interesting about it is like this sticker is

[00:09:06] **Robbie:** Oh, I do love that sticker.

[00:09:08] **Charles:** Yeah, that's a pretty good

[00:09:09] **Robbie:** Yeah. Shout out. Uh.

[00:09:11] **Charles:** Dev Tools

[00:09:12] **Robbie:** I forget his name. I know it's Hipster Smoothie. What's his actual name?

[00:09:15] **Charles:** eh?

[00:09:16] **Robbie:** Oh, sorry, Andrew.

[00:09:19] **Charles:** Uh, anyway, you were gonna say something about TypeScript before I interrupt you.


## Hot Takes

[00:09:22] **Robbie:** I was just trying to, to lead into the hot takes.

[00:09:25] **Charles:** Yes. So that's our big Hot Takes section. Go for it.

Yeah. I don't know. Uh, how much like TypeScript and CSS and stuff you're doing when you're doing Rails, like are you building full stack apps or doing more like API work, or like, like do these questions apply or not? I don't know.

[00:09:43] **Robby Russell:** Uh, that's a, that's an excellent question, Robbie. The Wagner. Personally I have not written more than maybe 20 lines of type script as of yet myself. The most of my work tends to be more on the backend side when I'm [00:10:00] helping deal with legacy apps and helping teams get things upgraded and stuff like that.

So on the coding side, I don't often get to play with a lot of the fancy news stuff. And if it, when it comes to, and maybe this is part of when I, uh, a consequence of coming up in an era where we needed to have people that were more focused on the front end to think about all the browser testing and dealing with all that stuff at the time that I would just leave that work to other people on the team that enjoyed making things work in IE six and seven, or at least.

[00:10:27] **Charles:** Mm-Hmm.

[00:10:27] **Robby Russell:** Begrudgingly begrudgingly, uh, make that that work across the different devices and make things work when things got responsive and or when we were building mobile specific app or versions of our web apps that we would build for our clients. So. I always just kind of like pushed the front end over to the other people on the team that were way more, that just seemed to have more of an act for thinking about all those, all the different contexts you needed to think about there.

The people that are, I always enjoyed walking around in the office and then seeing the people that would be like sliding their browsers with [00:11:00] back and forth on their screen to see how things were, like when the responsive error happened. And so that was someone else's responsibility, so that's what they were dealing with that when it came to more of that.

But I did do some JavaScript stuff, but a lot of that was pre things like, uh, react and stuff coming out and, and, um, I think the last frameworks that I worked with was when maybe Ember first came out. It was kind of a new thing. I, I did some work with that and we did some projects with Angular and React and, um, prior to that, doing a lot of stuff with like backbone and

[00:11:30] **Charles:** Ooh.

[00:11:30] **Robby Russell:** just raw JavaScript stuff as well.

So, but that was always more of a backend

[00:11:36] **Charles:** Yeah.

[00:11:37] **Robby Russell:** fine tuning on the, on the application side person.

[00:11:40] **Robbie:** that's

[00:11:40] **Charles:** Well, luckily ember's dead, so you don't have to do that anymore. And then, uh,

I inherited, we just inherited a project that is running on running on Ember, which has been a while since we've had many companies contact us for that. So, uh, that's only two weeks ago that that started for us. But yeah, re remembering what that world was like. And it's not that it's not [00:12:00] dead.

No, it's not. I just, because Robbie is still deeply involved even currently, and, uh, so I like to, to razz him a little bit. 


## Thoughts on ripping TypeScript out of projects

[00:12:08] **Charles:** See, I didn't know if you also were like taking, the, uh, ideologies, uh, uh, of DHH more recently of like ripping TypeScript out and, uh, moving to not compiling front end files and no trans pile, no compile, like serve your files as is and utilize more modern, uh, uh, web technologies versus falling back on these frameworks and build tools, sets and all of that.

I don't know if you have any thoughts around that, that side of things.

[00:12:42] **Robby Russell:** I think the, uh, you know, like with this, the controversy around them re ripping out tight script of, you know, that one particular project, um, I don't, I feel like I didn't really understand why there was such a big backlash against that, if that's a stick, a project that they decided to do that one particular thing.[00:13:00] 

As far as um, you know, like what our team's typically doing, we are tending to work slightly on slightly older apps and so we're always kind of stuck a little bit like five to eight years behind and trying to figure out how we're gonna iterate our way forward and help those apps get updated to get to use new things.

So, you know, one of the things we are working on quite a bit is doing a little bit more of like helping clients navigate the process of like adapting from say something like React and wanting to take advantage of things like Hotwire. In their apps. And so there's some other people on my team that are more focused in that side of things, that they have a better understanding of that.

Um, and coincidentally, I, my company also does a, every other year we do a survey of the Ruby and Rails community to get a sense of where people are using all the different tools. And so there's a lot of curiosity around like, are people potentially looking to migrate? What JavaScript package managers are they using now?

And like, what other frame JavaScript frameworks are they using with their apps? So I'll have more answers on like, what the General Rails community does. And we usually get close to, you know, 3000 people that [00:14:00] participate in that survey every couple years. And we've been doing that since 2009. And it's been interesting just to see how the ecosystem's kind of evolved over the time.

But my company tends to be a little bit further behind, only because we're the company that says we're, we're not, we're not as interested in building a new shiny, new app. We're, we're more, I'm more, I see myself as more of a me than a maker. I like to help improve things and iterate through things and try to help companies avoid needing to go down the, I'll advise big rewrite if, if possible.

[00:14:28] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[00:14:29] **Robby Russell:** like, wouldn't it be just great if we could just start over? Well, if you don't figure out how you're gonna keep things updated and technology keeps changing, and that's just, we do make our lives complicated sometimes as a, as a,

[00:14:40] **Robbie:** Oh yeah.

[00:14:41] **Robby Russell:** type

of, uh, the software industry, I think that's an excellent point around where like you're just trading some problems, this set of problems for a different set of problems. And if inherently your organ

[00:14:51] **Robbie:** over and over again. Yeah.

[00:14:53] **Charles:** yeah. And your organization isn't good at ma uh, updating their software over time, then that's always [00:15:00] gonna be the case.

So.

[00:15:02] **Robby Russell:** We, we have a lot of companies that'll contact us because they want us to help them just with the upgrade. And my, the first thing I tell them is, I think that's a really bad idea. You need to figure out how to get your own team to prioritize and navigate this stuff. It's a skillset you need to work on and iterate on that.

And we can come in and we'll take your money and help you do it, but I. It's, you're not really going to be reinforcing this as part of your process. And so I see companies will like, well, we'll just hire an extra senior person to come in and we'll just kind of like push them off and work on the upgrade.

And they have their get branch that they work on for a couple months and then they get pulled into the rest of the team's projects and it gets deprioritized and they don't remember where you left off. And it's like the same story over and over and over. And they're like, where was I? And then you try to bring other people in and you can't track your progress on those projects very well because it's a lot of like digging into rabbit holes regardless.

I, and I think this isn't a rebound rail specific that this, this is just a problem with anything. You're like, and then everybody's like, well I don't have enough test [00:16:00] coverage to rely on

[00:16:01] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[00:16:02] **Robby Russell:** that everything's gonna work. And like it's the same stories over and over and over. So that's where we kind of come in and like help teams try to like navigate that.

Help them also with when they're, when people are about to go down rabbit holes, be help them figure out like. Put that, that idea down for a moment. Like document it. What were you originally working on? And like help steer them in the right, maybe a different direction or like not just keep chasing things because you forget where you're at.

And then one of the problems that breaks down a lot of organizations is that the, say I'm air quoting the product, people lose confidence in their team's ability to estimate how long these things are going to take. The two, because they will give them an estimate and then they go off on Rabbit. Like, well there's all these things that popped up along the way.

And then like, and then if you ever, if you ever been in one of those conversations with a developer and they're just rattling off all the reasons and all the problems that a product person is like, I don't need to know all the details. Like, how much time do you think you're gonna, that you're gonna need?

And like, how much longer do do you need on this? And then eventually that erodes trust. And [00:17:00] so people stop ask saying, yeah, let's invest time there. We'll come back to it someday when you can get better estimates or you can get more focus. And then, and then developers will also then stop asking, for time to do that because they've, they've heard not right now, a few too many times.

And then it just becomes like a weird situation to work out. So trying to come in and help teams kind of navigate that is, what I'm, I've been working on to be like, what as a, a super strength I suppose, or, um, a superhero type thing. But I'm not, I'm not here to save the day. I'm here to help teams figure this shit out for themselves.

[00:17:32] **Robbie:** Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense too. 'cause it's like, you know, like you said, if you don't teach them how to do it later, they're just gonna have more problems and like teams never prioritize this. It's a problem at like. 80% of places I've worked where it's just like, just do features. Just do features.

Just do features like we'll eventually hire someone else to update all this stuff 'cause we need you to just do features all the time. And it's like, why? Like we should care. Like that is a built in feature is upgrading 'cause [00:18:00] it's gonna be faster and more performant and like

[00:18:02] **Charles:** Mm-Hmm.

[00:18:03] **Robbie:** more secure usually. Like there's a lot of security vulnerabilities that happen when you're stuck on a eight years old thing and then you're just like, oh shit, what do I do now?

And like yeah, it's, it's a hard

[00:18:13] **Charles:** estimation is bullshit too, especially to the level that most, teams try to estimate too, because you get these project level things and even if you break that down a little bit and they're like, I don't know, tell me small, medium, large. And then they still try and internally translate that. Oh, a

[00:18:32] **Robbie:** more than

[00:18:33] **Charles:** six weeks.

[00:18:33] **Robbie:** a week, it's too big. Like if you can't confidently say like you should ship little tiny pieces and then you'd be like. This is done, this is done. This is done. Instead of like, I'm gonna build this for four months. Like,

[00:18:45] **Charles:** Yeah. I don't it. Yeah. Yeah. Making smaller commitments is the only way that you can have confident. I can, I can confidently estimate things that are like two days or less

[00:18:56] **Robbie:** Yeah. Changing that button color, probably five

[00:18:59] **Charles:** 20 years [00:19:00] though. Yeah. Until you get in there and realize that it's attached to some dependency that you don't control, that overrides it and some, yeah.

Some other ridiculous things. So anyway, uh, I, I'm gonna regress now back to hot takes. Before we just talk about serious things. 


## GetRebase or GetMerge?

[00:19:18] **Charles:** And, uh, this is an important one I think you may have a opinion on get Rebase or get merge.

[00:19:27] **Robby Russell:** Oh, that's a good one. I am on team get merge.

[00:19:33] **Charles:** Hmm.



[00:19:34] **Charles:** I'm a little surprised. I'm gonna say given your tenure in the space and, 

[00:19:38] **Robby Russell:** It has been easier for me to work my way out of weird, tricky things and to also work with say other, pair with other people and help them kind of wrap their head around it. So I think it's just more of like, Hey, can we set this stuff aside and merge, like navigate it that way and. Yeah, maybe the, the secret the secret is out is like, [00:20:00] even though I might be, have been around the GI world for such a long time, that there's a lot about git that I don't really wrap my head around enough.

And then I'm just like, I don't, I think maybe also because of the types of projects that I end up working on, I'm usually not needing to sync up that much stuff. I say that with some, to some, some degree of there, but no, yeah, tend to, tend to lean more on, get merg than get rebates.

[00:20:22] **Robbie:** Yeah, I think if you're working on a branch with anyone else. That's probably the better choice 'cause I've gotten screwed over a ton about like rebasing or they rease and you like forget to like reset before you start working and then you go to like, pull and there's like changes 'cause they've all changed and all the hashes are different.

And like you go, I don't know, like I usually end up then just throwing all of the like, like I keep my changes, but I throw all the history away and just like copy everything over and be like, there you go. Like,

so. just pretend this never happened.

Yeah, yeah. It's hard. 

[00:20:58] **Robby Russell:** It's a lukewarm take, I [00:21:00] suppose from, for me.

[00:21:01] **Charles:** I, I think given, running an agency, I mean, that's a smart position I think to take what is the most inclusive.

[00:21:09] **Robbie:** yeah, that's true. Uh, 


## Left or right sidebar in VS Code?

[00:21:12] **Robbie:** sidebar on the left or right of vs. Code.

[00:21:15] **Robby Russell:** um, left for my folders and stuff like that. Yeah, it's on the

[00:21:20] **Robbie:** Mm-Hmm. Okay.

[00:21:21] **Charles:** Yeah.

[00:21:22] **Robby Russell:** Uh, what's on the right? I think sometimes I have the, uh, like the, the zoomed out version of or view where you can kind of, I mean, if you're a really, really long, long file just to kind of get a sense of where you're at.

But I don't use the right too often for anything. What about you two?

[00:21:39] **Charles:** Yeah. Left is the default and I'm

[00:21:41] **Robbie:** Yeah. I don't, I don't know why

[00:21:43] **Robby Russell:** think I've ever really thought about it that much.

[00:21:44] **Robbie:** yeah, This was a weird thing on Twitter where like ev, there were like a couple people who were like, I put it on the right, and it's like, what? Why? And it like, the only argument I've heard is like, because they open and close it a lot and like then their code doesn't jump [00:22:00] around.

'cause their code is always just aligned to the left. And I'm like, well, who cares? Like, just like, yeah, it moves for a second, but you're probably not opening and closing it every like five seconds. So it's like,

[00:22:11] **Robby Russell:** I, I rely, I mean, and maybe this kind of speaks to, um, even like, oh, my Z shell, but like I, I'm a lazy developer in the sense that I, I do rely a lot on hotkeys.

So like the folder view, navigating manually with my mouse to try to find things is. Like, I only do that when I'm like really struggling to remember and find something. But otherwise I'm usually just like open up a file and then I'm just kind of like tabbing between the tabs. And that's how I think about navigating and like my, I don't need the, the visual reminder of where things sit necessarily in the folder, but I say that to some degree, but I think that's, so, yeah, I, I get that whole like opening and closing that, that's an interesting thought there.

But I think it's just more of like left to right to me is just like the thing is over here and then I open it and it [00:23:00] shows up over here and that just seems intuitive for how my brain and maybe an our culture, how we learn how things are organized. I don't know how that is in other parts of the world where they might, where writing is different and maybe, maybe directions are a little differently.

Organ.

[00:23:16] **Robbie:** true. That's true. That's

[00:23:18] **Charles:** Yeah, I hadn't actually thought about that one. Like the context of someone who would prefer the right versus if they read and right to left. Anyway, so interesting. 


## What do you think about nested ternary's?

[00:23:29] **Charles:** What about something highly important like nested Aries? When do you think about those?

[00:23:35] **Robby Russell:** What the hell's a nested teary?

[00:23:37] **Charles:** It's a ary within a RN area. Within a RN area, potentially.

[00:23:42] **Robby Russell:** No comment. Um,

[00:23:44] **Charles:** Would you ever do that?

[00:23:46] **Robby Russell:** I'm googling nested, turn teary and wondering if I'm just not a savvy enough programmer here to even

[00:23:53] **Robbie:** It's like,

[00:23:55] **Charles:** join the Rails community? I mean, me either. Okay, perfect. I'm [00:24:00] in. I have no problem with Rails, so

[00:24:01] **Robbie:** Yeah, it's, it's not super important. 

[00:24:03] **Robby Russell:** Didn't go to like a proper educations when it comes to software programming or anything. I'm a high school dropout and. So when it comes to like, I know how to do, like, so we talking like nested conditionals versus using like case statement type situations or

[00:24:19] **Charles:** exactly that. Basically kind of, so.

[00:24:22] **Robbie:** area is just like where you do the question mark and the, uh, colon instead of an if else. So it's like a shorthand for an if else, but then yeah, nest that shit really deep and it gets really gross looking.

[00:24:34] **Robby Russell:** no, no, no. I, I don't, well, no nesting that stuff is if it's too hard to read and follow for someone, like that's the whole point of software is the code, otherwise we'd just be writing Zeros level, you know? So it's just like how simple can we make this for other people to come in and understand what the hell's going on.

So is as expressive as we can be. And if you need a lot of documentation or comments in your code to explain what's happening, then I would say, I would think [00:25:00] unless just some like performance thing that you're maybe getting, get gain at it and there's like a very explicit ver reason for doing that. 99% of the time I'd be like, let's just, how.

Stupidly simple. Can you make this to your future self or to some other person that's gonna come and look at this project? 'cause someone else is gonna potentially inherit this project from you. And as the person that often ends up inheriting a lot of projects, I can tell you that I would just prefer people just to be verbose. Not to the sense where it's like, or, or unnecessarily or verbose, but at least verbose enough that I can get a understanding like, why is this here? What is it doing? And, and can I, how do I make changes to it? And then if it's when you end up getting too clever, then it makes it harder for you to know how to change it.

So that's when you start adding bandaids and weird patches and circumventing things. And rather

than,

you probably should just refactor that whole thing anyways, when, when to understand it.

[00:25:56] **Charles:** you're It's usually not being considerate to the [00:26:00] next person who might look at your work.

[00:26:01] **Robbie:** Yeah.

Yeah. I remember like I. I think if you did loops backwards in JavaScript, it was like a little bit faster.



[00:26:09] **Robbie:** So like I would occasionally see people do that where like instead of doing like, you know, I zero, I plus plus, you do like, you start at the highest number and you decrement I is like somehow faster.

I don't understand why, but like, I'm like, no, just do it the way that's easy to read. Like the performance gains you're getting are so negligible. Just do it like the way people can follow it. But anyway,

[00:26:31] **Robby Russell:** that's interesting. I wonder if there's something about like the, if you're iterating through like a collection of something, is it gets, is it gets smaller?

Does it just be quicker to know how many are left in it? Or I don't understand how this stuff works on 

[00:26:44] **Robbie:** maybe.

Yeah, I have no idea.

[00:26:46] **Robby Russell:** retaining the same one over and over and over and just getting into the next thing in it, or can you anyway? Yeah. That's interesting.

[00:26:55] **Robbie:** Yeah. Yes. 


## Is Rails going to be the best way to write web applications again?

[00:26:58] **Robbie:** So I do want to circle back [00:27:00] to Rails a bit. Um, so Rails is like, feel like back in the spotlight these days. Like, um, you know, you always take whatever DHH says with a grain of salt, but he said something like, in like, I guess this year or next year, which year he said, but like, you know, rails, what's the new one?

Eight that's coming out is like, he's like, it's gonna be the best way to write web applications. And like, I wanted to get your thoughts on that because I feel like he's maybe not wrong. Like, we're kind of regressing back to all of like, old is new again. And like, you know, all these things that weren't sexy for so long is like, well actually it's been working forever and it works better than ever now, so why

[00:27:40] **Charles:** I, I think we're reassessing the web platform and people have, uh, forgotten about it. And, you know, uh, remember all the things that kind of forced us in some other directions and they, you know, now they're committed to react. Now they're committed to whatever their tool chain is. And so they just keep trying to improve that versus come [00:28:00] back to the core.

Let's look what are the native APIs? What's the web platform look like now? And how, you know, can we actually just leverage that as much as possible instead? I mean, that's what it feels like to me. I.

[00:28:13] **Robby Russell:** having been part of the Ruby and Rails community for it's over 19 years or something. It's wild. Uh, just say out loud, it's so funny 'cause like early on in the days it was always an argument about like, rails is too new. You can't use this in real, you can't use this for real applications, and we should be using Java.

And I think Java was not even like five, 10 years old at the time when I was having those arguments with people. And now, 20 years later, um, here we are, uh, defending why it's still useful and relevant. But I think the, there's a couple things I think that have happened. One. I think teams, especially in the, in the most last few years, are needing to do more with less people.

And so I think there's that part of it and that's, I think that Ruby on Rails was always really like [00:29:00] when it, when it came out and it landed up saying the air quoting the market, but the, the market of software options and frameworks for building web applications, uh, it removed a lot of, uh, other roles maybe or running like roles that were a lot of companies used to rely on.

Like, you, you, you thought differently about do we need a DBA on our projects? Do we need, you know, someone that manages, just thinking about like all of the. Business logic would be tied up in your database. And like the idea that that, and that was a hard thing for me when I came to Rails, was like trusting that the active record layer was going to be a good protector of the data and manage that the, the state of our database really well.

Because prior to that it was a lot of, every app I ever worked on, every other programming language was, was a little bit different. And it was like, what was the flavor of at that point in time. And so Rails just provided a really good set of conventions like, Hey, if we follow you, stick within these parameters.

We make a lot of decisions for you. You can build web apps, you can focus on building things and shipping things quicker. And I think that [00:30:00] was really exciting. At the time, it was like us, it was kind of like a, going away from the like, let's see how geeky we can be as software developers. Look how clever we were.

And it ended up being more like, let's just build stuff and ship stuff and let's see if this stuff works and we can make a business out of this versus like these other, you know, kind of experimental things that we're doing or needing a much larger team of people in specialized roles. So Rails became like, was early on, like kind of like a one person framework from the beginning and it's.

Then I know that d hh is using that in how he talks about it now as well. But it's true, like you can do a lot as like a, with a really small team, and a lot of companies have grown their organizations and grown lots of teams. And so there's definitely some, some aspects as any type of software platform, as your teams grow, it becomes more complicated to try to like all share the same code base.

And so I can understand why companies like a lot of experience, you know, like, well, let's split off and do a lot of microservices. Let's split off the front [00:31:00] end stuff. We can use this new stuff. Um, there's a lot of, and the JavaScript frameworks have always been coming and going over the years and, um, and so trying to find ways how to make that all work together and Rails kind of in a weird way became like, oh, a really good option for like the API would be.

So there's a lot of companies that use rebrand rails as the backend, API, and you can just throw any front end and you're at some point you're gonna rewrite the front end when in a new platform. Um, and that, that's happened sometimes I feel like that's. That ideas probably happened less in reality than I think a lot of people told themselves they were gonna do that.

'cause we see a lot of teams that will, will do that, where they'll split up, you know, the back end and the head and they're like, well we're gonna have multiple front end applications at some point. And so they have different teams or people that are maybe cross developing across both those platforms.

But they can be like, well let's use the best tool for the front end and we'll use Rails in the backend. And then a couple years later, their team's smaller all of a sudden 'cause they had layoffs or they just don't need that many people anymore. And now [00:32:00] they're responsible for many code bases in parallel.

And every change requires going into two different applications and trying to get that all in sync. And it's like, it's, it's a lot of work. Uh, 'cause you're

not necessarily

set up to have like atomic commits and your deployments are all separated. And so like they, it's been, I feel like there's an interesting thing there around having the platform. So I, I think people are reevaluating now like, whoa, maybe that it was interesting. We needed a lot of other different types of skill sets and things like that, as you know. And I've always thought that was a natural split, the front and the back end. 'cause speaking of my earlier comments that like, I didn't want to think about all the web browser related stuff.

Like there's other people can think about that and let me focus on the business logic side of things, but I think as like with Rails eight coming out and like there's a lot of people, maybe if you're starting a new application, do you should, is it a good idea to spin up multiple repos with different technology stacks in parallel and be like, let's build a new app, a new platform.

[00:33:00] Now when I think Rails is putting a compelling argument to be like, Hey, let's, we can do this all on Rails. You can split off when you need to at some point, but like, let's see how far you can give with just one application for all your different use cases and stuff like that. So.

[00:33:15] **Charles:** w what I like about that ideology is that I think that resourcing is a big different way to think about that, right? So we've gone through now like a wave of era that is very VC driven, where. Ideas will get you lots of money to get started, which means get you multiple people to build, which means you can have a greater separation of concerns, right?

And there's been a massive pullback in that. And now you have to think about resource wise, I have this idea, I can't even begin to raise money until I'm actually, I have users and show revenue. I mean, that's starting to happen a whole bunch. And I can't do any of that stuff as a, a single [00:34:00] contributor.

What's my accelerant now? Now I start to look at like, what's what, what is in, you know what, what in software accelerates me. I no longer now want to think about like auth either implementing someone else's or rolling my own. I don't want to think about ORMs, I don't wanna think about, you know, all of that.

Kind of like, oh, it's cool, there's whole companies about this and you can get it as a service. But you still have to do work to get it into your application, and then you have to spend money and all of these things, holy, these full stack web application frameworks, the rails, the jengo, that kind of stuff that now becomes really, uh, relevant.

And part of the conversation isn't because you need all this to get outta the gate, right?

[00:34:43] **Robby Russell:** And, and not needing to think about. You know, it's interesting thinking about how they're with the next version of Rails that there's a lot of emphasis on thinking about, like, here's some, we're gonna include now, like some guidance on how to deploy the thing. Whether or not you agree that that's the best approach.

[00:35:00] But like we can, you know, you can just like, let's just simplify that part of the process because, you know, if, if you're a, we, again, I go back to, 'cause we, I worked in the consulting side of things, we come in a lot of different scenarios where there might be teams that had at one point had 25, 30 engineers on their team and now they have five



[00:35:18] **Robby Russell:** and they're like, we have all this stuff, the deployment processes, like we have all this Terraform stuff that some other guy wrote a couple years ago.

We know how to make some changes to it, but we're afraid of breaking it. Um, and then, and they're just like, we don't know what, what's running on our AWS account. They're afraid to turn stuff off. And then, so it's just like a. like cheap to spin things up and now there's kind of like a, well maybe we could start a little smaller again and like maybe also, maybe we shouldn't be individually SSHing into servers and running like app get updates and upgrade ourselves and like maybe there's some ways we can streamline that a little bit now and like the fact that Rails is like gonna start including that stuff is kind of exciting for new projects.

[00:36:00] It's also like, again, because I tend to work on older apps, it's kind of like a little outta reach. I'm like, oh that's great. But it's also kinda reminding me, I'm like some of, maybe we can unpack some of and undo some of this stuff for some of our clients that they've invested in and be like, Hey, when you were making those decisions, you thought your team was gonna keep exponentially growing to some degree, maybe not exponentially, but like, you know, like, Hey, we're a team of five and we're like gonna be adding five more people.

We'll be 10 and maybe in a couple more years we'll be 20, 30 people. How do we think about, how are we making technical choices that supports a team at that size? I've very rarely ever heard a team be realistic, be like, what happens when our team is actually going to be smaller?

[00:36:37] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[00:36:37] **Robby Russell:** Yeah, nobody thinks about getting smaller as like an ideal thing, but, uh, software eventually will.

I either it gets the, the power cord gets plugged at some point, but it's probably not when there's 50 people on the team anymore. And it's probably a few people left working on it. And so at that point, and not that you should be making decisions to be like planning on only having like the one or two people left on your project, [00:37:00] still keeping it running and stuff like that.

But if it's too complicated for a few people to understand the whole, then it might be good back to come back to those kind of first principles and just like, what are we doing here? How do we make this simpler? Do we need this much complexity and the complexity we needed to support growing is maybe not what we need now And how do we unpack that?

And then a lot of teams that are smaller now, they don't feel like they have the resources or time to do that. And so those organizations are kind of in a shitty situation. And so, which is why they need maybe companies like mine to come in and maybe help them navigate some of those things, but.

[00:37:36] **Charles:** Yeah.

[00:37:37] **Robby Russell:** It's, it's, it's tricky, but I think it's good to question why you're making those decisions and see if you can still support it and know that you're probably gonna change your mind in a few years too.

So how do you add something and how can you remove it or swap it out? And so it's, it's, it's tricky.

[00:37:52] **Charles:** The bus factor is pretty bad there. If, uh, you're, you're growing and you know, you're very dependent on [00:38:00] A and B person potentially, and then A and b go away, what happens? Uh, you know, there, there's a big, big bit of that, although it's funny that a lot of the things you said are very, like, counterproductive to probably what, you know, a bunch of your business is fueled by is you, you tell them the problems.

You want people to do the wrong thing. I mean, you don't want to, they just do it anyway, right? Like you say, all right, here I am. It for, for us not to see each other again in a couple of years. This is what you should do. And then. Inevitably,

[00:38:37] **Robby Russell:** I mean, maybe a, a mission is to put myself out of a job, but, and, and that'll be my legacy, is that like there was no more of these, these problems aren't gonna go away. These they need to be talked about. And just in the same way, like if all coaches is gen, you know, could coach their athletes to be the best, highest performing people, great.

But there's a reason why they're still coaches and there's a reason why they're still [00:39:00] therapists. People learn a little bit. Some people retain that information and can iterate on that, and some of them don't and some of 'em forget. And then you reminding and that's okay too. Um, you know, listen to my podcast and maybe a book one day.

Um,

[00:39:14] **Charles:** Oh, there you go. Listen to his podcast. I agree.


## Any suggestions for podcasts?

[00:39:18] **Robbie:** Speaking of which, do you have any, tips or tricks or like things for people who may want to start a podcast or like, 

[00:39:27] **Charles:** Or, uh.

[00:39:28] **Robbie:** to like,

[00:39:29] **Charles:** Or improve their podcast or like upgrade their co-hosts, or, I mean, you know, just hypothetically

[00:39:35] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[00:39:36] **Robby Russell:** Well, I think I do like the idea of like starting your podcast off with whiskey as a good business expense.

[00:39:42] **Robbie:** Mm-Hmm.

[00:39:43] **Robby Russell:** that's, that, that's wise. Uh, I think finding something that you're excited and passionate about, um, or at least enjoy consuming when I started my podcast, I think it was, I think I knew about two years before I did my first interview, what I wanted to do [00:40:00] and my goal was to capture conversations with people to talk about what I believe is the, a topic that we don't often talk about.

What, just how complicated it is to take care of existing code and legacy code and like a large part of our job is coming into existing situations, working on them. We're rarely ever getting to be the person that spins up a brand new application. Most developers don't get to do that all at often outside of their own little personal hobby projects.

If a company is hiring you. They probably already have some code and they need you to jump in and wrap your head around it. And I think the, I've often wondered that we've done a disservice as to, and are thinking about how we educate and, and, and shine a light on like, Hey, is this a good industry to to, to join as a career?

Because if you're gonna get to be a creator, you're gonna be get to make things, you know, you're building all these new things all the time. And I think I've seen a lot of people come into the industry and they go through like a coding bootcamp and they, they've learned how to build some stuff. They work on some bug fixes for [00:41:00] things.

They get, they do their internships at companies like mine. They get their first job and they're like, all I do is fix bugs and like make small little updates. And they're like, I thought I was gonna be building new features all the time. And I'm like, that's. Part of some people's job sometimes, but a lot of maintenance, a lot of the project work is maintenance work and taking care of things, and you kind of learn through that over a period of time.

So I wanted to have conversations with people, just let people like that is actually a really big part of the job and we're often in the res the role of mentors, not makers. And so I wanted to capture conversations that I thought would be relevant, not just now, but also like in a decade or more. So we don't, I don't talk a lot about what's new and shiny in technology.

I don't talk about hot takes very often. Um, just recently I had a couple conversations with people 'cause about AI and, and how it can be helpful for that stuff, but not because like, what's new and where do you think AI is gonna go for is industry. So that was like the, at least coming up with a premise that I thought was like.

Moderately unique. I feel like there's a lot of interesting podcasts around [00:42:00] what's new and happening and, and so then you're competing with everybody else that's talking about what's new and happening, which is important stuff to be talking about. Don't get me wrong. Um, people like to talk about that and, but I also, I live in a world where I often work in, as I said, projects that are several years old and I'm like, and a lot of people that are working on projects that are far behind on versions and things like that, and they're just like, well, that sounds great, but I'm never gonna be there.

You know, we're, we're always gonna be way behind. So if, if I listen to a podcast or go to a conference and hear about the what's new in Rails eight, great. Maybe we'll get there in five years maybe, or May, or, or they dream that the only way to get to that scenario is to go job, to job hop to another company where they think the grass is greener.

And then they'll get to work on a brand new version of something and then they learn that that's not always the case either. So, um, anyway, so as far as that part of it, that was just like figuring out what my, that was my focus for my project and I also wanted to be not technology stack. Focused and so I didn't wanna talk with just Ruby and RA's people.

I wanna talk with people of all different [00:43:00] spectrums and hear different stories and have a lot of similar conversations with a lot of wide variety of people. So that was my angle. The other, so in terms of other things about the process, I don't do the editing. I've never done the editing. I knew that I would be a bottleneck, so I immediately found an, an editor originally on Upwork, and they did a hundred and something episodes with us before I had to get my second editor, which I have now.

I knew that it needed to be, I can handle the upfront part of the process of finding guests, prepare for the interviews, handle all the communications with the guests up until the interview, have the interview, automate as much as that stuff as I possibly could, and then throw some files into a Dropbox.

Folder for our editor and be like, great. And then someone else would pick him up, pick up those, the output of that process, and then they would, you know, organize all the social media assets and publish it on the web and then schedule that and let the guests know that their episode was published when it was ready.

So that was the first, that was something I knew I needed to do. And so until I had that kind of whole pipeline organized, I didn't want to like, release anything. And the other thing I made myself do [00:44:00] was like, I'm gonna record 10 episodes before I tell anybody publicly that this was a thing. I'm like, I, I wanted to get ahead

[00:44:06] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[00:44:07] **Robby Russell:** me get 10 episodes and then I could rearrange which episodes I was gonna have first.

And so then like, maybe my first one, which I still would think was one of my weakest ones. 'cause I didn't, I was trying to navigate being a, an interviewer. Uh, and I can kind of rearrange that a little bit based off of how I felt like those first S one went. , I didn't wanna be, I, I just, I become this person that's bit hesitant to talk publicly about things until it's ready.

I'd rather just like, 'cause I've, I have projects I've worked on in the past where like, Hey, I got a book deal. And then like, sign up and then you find out like six months later, by the way, I'm not gonna finish the book now. I'm sorry I asked for your email address six months ago. I don't want to be like vaporware vapor announcements stuff.

Like, people do that all the time. And I'm just like, I'm like, no, actually do the thing and be like, I, hey, cool. You know, I, I, so that was another thing. I think if you can hold it back, I felt much more [00:45:00] exciting to be like, you can actually participate now. You can get, you can buy the thing now. You can subscribe now and start listening right now.

To me, that's, that feels like a much more exciting thing rather than, I, I need that as the motivator is like, I know that I can get people to sign up, but I'd, I'd rather it actually just be like, this is dropped. 

[00:45:18] **Robbie:** Yeah, there's a lot of podcasts that I've seen that'll, they get really hype about doing it. They like make a cool logo, they like record an episode or two and they're done. And it's like, yeah, if you do at least 10 that, you know, builds that muscle memory and that like habit and you're probably gonna keep doing it.

And yeah, it's, it, it lets you know, if you hate it, like eight episodes in, you should just stop and not even release it because like, you're not gonna keep going. So yeah, that is, that's really good advice, I think.

[00:45:45] **Robby Russell:** You can also then determine if maybe that was a one, one time thing, you could just release those eight to 10 episodes and be like, this was a one time thing. Here's a capturing, there's not gonna be a season two. And [00:46:00] this was, this was a catalog of some, uh, conversations I wanted to share.

There's one, one series TV shows all the time. That's like a, just call it a, it's a limited series. You could just reframe it. So anyway, there's a lot of different ways you can think about that kind of stuff, but I think if you try to do one at a time and release as you go, then. It's really easy to fall off the wagon and, and, and not keep up the, you haven't build up the, uh, the consistency of it.

And, um, and the other thing I would recommend is like, when it comes to like finding guests, is I put a lot of energy into trying to find very diverse groups of people on to be on the podcast. And now to the point where people ask me o often like, Hey, can I be on your podcast? Or, I have a recommendation for somebody to be on your podcast, usually like a PR company or something.

And I'm like, I don't wanna talk about like what's the new and shiny, but I now secret hack is when they, when someone reaches out to me, I'm like, I'm, I'm open to having you on the podcast, but I need you to give me at least three recommendations for other guests that you think would also be good guests on

[00:46:55] **Charles:** Ooh, I like that.

[00:46:57] **Robby Russell:** And so before I will schedule with you, gimme that list, [00:47:00] and then they'll gimme a list and then follow up question. Do you have any women that you can recommend?

[00:47:04] **Charles:** Mm mm-Hmm.

[00:47:06] **Robby Russell:** like, so that puts some work into that process. I can kind of offload that onto other guests and they will usually give me good guest recommendations.

Um, and then when people say like, I don't have any women to recommend to you to be on the podcast, and they can be like, well, let me know when you can.

Um, 

and

[00:47:23] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[00:47:24] **Robby Russell:** so I think like that, that, that tends to be a good way. And then, so I have like a pretty large list of like, potential guests and then it's always just a matter of just trying to get them scheduled and my own, I've got a lot of things I'm focused on as well outside of just having a podcast.

That's

not quite I hear that.

[00:47:42] **Charles:** Yeah.



[00:47:43] **Robbie:** Yeah. 


## Pronouncing and working on Oh My Zsh

[00:47:44] **Robbie:** Speaking of, uh, other things you have going on, I do want to talk about, and you said it's Oh, my Z shell, I always said, oh, my ZSH, but

[00:47:53] **Charles:** I've always said, oh my Z

[00:47:54] **Robbie:** yeah. Oh, have you, you said Z Shell always, damn. Okay. I'm in the

[00:47:58] **Charles:** because Zish is the, [00:48:00] uh, yeah. 'cause ZSH is, uh, like that's the, the file type thing or whatever. Anyway. A Z shell. Yeah. I've always said

[00:48:08] **Robby Russell:** I say Z shell typically, um, it's,

I get like you have some authority here.

Yeah. Well, I Yeah. You get to decide. Yeah.

well zhe, if you could just go to like the Z Shell website or I, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere there's a pronunciation for just Z Shell itself. And then for for Oma, shell, I just, I think it'd be weird for me to pronounce it otherwise, but if you're people say Z shell, because that's just how they say z

Um, in some places,

um, I have a recording on my Twitter profile and it's, I pronounce it omi and that tends to people, I was just at a conference down in Brazil and a lot of people brought that up and they thought it was funny.

And I'm like, I don't know why I'm telling you about my own jokes here, but, um.

[00:48:53] **Charles:** think it's 'cause you had some whiskey. That's

[00:48:55] **Robby Russell:** that's true. I'm gonna pour a little bit more.

[00:48:57] **Charles:** Yeah. Do it.

because I, [00:49:00] yeah, it's funny. It kinda makes me think of, uh, my dot files. A couple of things that I always set up on my new computer is home Brew. Oh my z show. Like, and then I've got my antigen themes and you know, all that kind I think Robbie is so honored that you, you use it,

[00:49:19] **Robby Russell:** Mm-Hmm.

[00:49:20] **Robbie:** you're such an important force. Charles. William Carpenter,

iii.

Yeah. Yeah. You, uh, everything I'm doing that's right in the world is a, you know, you're a part of it.

Yeah. See, I'm the weird one who uses fish,

[00:49:33] **Robby Russell:** I use fish too. I Oh, it. I don't use, I'm,

[00:49:37] **Charles:** That

[00:49:38] **Robbie:** oh, amazing.

[00:49:39] **Charles:** Oh, I used to use that like 10 years ago, but now I don't. But anyway,

[00:49:43] **Robby Russell:** I I feel like I'd be, uh, turning in my back. Uh, we're coming up on, it's interesting, we're coming up on the 15th. It was a birthday anniversary. What do you, what do you say

[00:49:52] **Robbie:** Yeah. Anniversary. Yeah.

[00:49:53] **Charles:** Anniversary is

good. 


## The origin story of Oh My Zsh

[00:49:54] **Charles:** Yeah. uh, this summer will be 15 years and the, it was feature complete when I first [00:50:00] released it. And, and because all I wanted was my coworkers when we'd be pairing on their computers to have the same aliases and shortcuts that I used because I'm a lazy typer and I couldn't remember everything.

[00:50:10] **Robby Russell:** I'm like, I just have all these commands and all these other things, like three, four character things. Uh, prior to using, you know, before OMI z Shell existed in my crazy Z Shell configuration. Before that, uh, I used to rely a lot on like things like, uh, text expander and things like that. It was always about just speeding up my process to have a bunch of shortcuts for things.

And so, but anyways, yeah, it's always Z shell is how I pronounce it. And 15 years and all I wanted my success was I convinced them all to install this thing because they wouldn't just copy my Z Shell RC file because they didn't understand what it did. And I was like, well, I don't really understand what it all does either.

It was like a copy and paste with a bunch of different friends and I, some tweaks that I had made over the years from different other people, primarily from the Ruby and Rails community. Um, stuff I'd copied off of like a, I dunno if you remember, there used to be a website called Pasty back in the [00:51:00] day.

And so we used, it was kind of like a, like a GitHub gist type of page where people could throw up like a file of code. So we were always like sharing little recipes on how to improve your Z shell configuration. And I just loved the auto complete features and some stuff like that in there. And the, uh, they wouldn't use, my team wouldn't, mostly people on my team wouldn't just copy my Z shell configuration, even though I, it was perfect obviously 'cause I created it.

Um, I'm like, well if you want me to work on your computer with you and help you do some coding with you, but, and I'm, and I'm doing typing, please add this stuff 'cause it's just hideous to try to remember how to do this. Um, or looking at the, the man page. For the, for the full syntax. And, but then one weekend I was like, I'm gonna document and clean up my vis shell configuration just so that I understand what it does, so I can explain it to them.

And then maybe that'll allow them the copy and paste it. And then as I did that, I'm like, oh, I'm gonna reorganize it. So I created a directory and I started organizing stuff into different sections and then I broke them out into some separate files and I was like, well, I'll kind of [00:52:00] treat this like, like, a little framework of some sort.

And it was just a directory with some sub folders and stuff like that. And, and like a template file. And like the install was basically get cloned the thing and then copy this file into, or copy this thing your zha RC file. And you would use it, and it didn't, it didn't have plugins, it didn't have themes, anything that people would reference.

Now, none of that existed the day first, the first day because it was literally just all of my configuration. And then like day two, every, everybody on my team in, in I'm air quoting, installed it. And then, then the next step was the next day, one of my team members, Carlos, said, how do I change the colors?

And I said, why? My color choices are perfect. He's like, oh, I'm gonna change the, I'm gonna add some different characters and change how that looks. And I'm like, well, that's stupid. Um, so he, I'm like, we'll just edit this file. Like, it was like a terminal or prompt file or something that I had in there. So he made changes and then we, he wanted to add [00:53:00] some new aliases as well.

And then, so he did and pushed it, you know, pushed it to my, was sharing my GI repository with the team. And so everybody was like adding stuff, but there was a problem. He couldn't. He couldn't do a get pull because there was now a merge conflict because he had made changes in his file, in the prop file.

And so I added inflection or this, what do we do? Carlos has his changes and I have mine. I can either put a conditional, if it's Carlos do this, or if it's Robbie's do this. And I'm like, that's not gonna be, that doesn't look good. So we created a concept like, well, I guess this is a theme. So we created a directory called Themes, stuck his file in there and stuck mine in there.

And then you just added the thing and it would just load the specific theme. And then a couple weeks and then I shared it on my blog and people started using it and then started getting contributions. And then someone from like the Python community, it was like, Hey, I don't need all these rails aliases. I want to have some stuff forgo. And I was like, well that's stupid. so I was like, [00:54:00] alright. And so I moved all my rail stuff into a Rails file and I'm like, I guess that's a plugin. And we've got. Python plugins or Django plugins. And that's, that's how it all like started was just people being like, I want I, I don't want all of your stuff, Robbie.

Even though it was like, oh, my z shell it my Z shell, it became like everybody thought of it was their Zs shell as well, I guess my zhe. So it just snowballed and everybody started, you know, throwing ideas in it. Like, oh, I wanna do it for this thing, and here's a command line thing. And then, you know, a couple hundred themes and hundreds of plugins later.

It's like, how did this, it became an easy project for people to contribute to. But that's the kind of like origin story. I didn't have this master creative plan, like, I'm gonna do this thing that everybody's gonna love. It was like, how do I get everybody in my team to have all those aliases so when we're pairing we can all save a few keystrokes?

And

[00:54:51] **Charles:** Scratch your own itch.

[00:54:52] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[00:54:53] **Charles:** Yeah.

[00:54:54] **Robbie:** Yeah. So how has your experience been with like, you know, it, it sounded like a lot of people just kind of contributed [00:55:00] organically, but, you know, I feel like it's this big problem with open source that like everyone expects everything. It's like, we're entitled for this to work on everything. I could possibly use it on, like, I'm gonna run this on my microwave and it's using like bash and not seashell and like, I, it should all work like, you know.

How, how much of that have you gotten? And like, you know, how do you, how do you deal with like, deciding what should go in and, and like, like how all that works?

[00:55:24] **Robby Russell:** works? The, well, I mean as far as like the bash versus, I mean, it's, that one's easy enough. It's like, well, it relies on Z shell, so, but there's all people have cloned the concept and there's like, oh my bash, there's, you know, I think a lot of stuff in the fish stuff was somewhat inspired by oh, my z as well.

And like there's oh, my posh for like Windows people. So there's, there's similar variants of it that have kind of spawned. But as far as the, the project itself, a couple of complex parts or periods of time where. [00:56:00] The, I was having a lot of people contribute and we were like working on things that we, we thought about the plugin system in particular.

Like, well, if everything is, includes, one of the biggest complaints we've always had is like, oh, it's Amer gonna air quote, bloated. I mean, it's like all a bunch of text files. So if, if it's taken up too much space in your computer, you know, maybe get a bigger hard drive. But that's fine. Uh, it's not, it's not that crazy.

Um, it's not, and you're only loading what you need. but there was some conversations around how are we going to make this project, or how, how do we think about plugins? Um, and so we thought about this like building some more complicated plugin system that would require, and one idea that got proposed, and this was many years ago, was to use, Git submodules for that.

And as we, and as we navigated and we're going through and testing things out, I was like, you know what? This seems so complicated for someone new to a terminal environment. We're, they're just learning GI in general. Like even rather they can even answer the question on GI merge versus GI rebates. Like let alone, like they do a git [00:57:00] clone, they can do some really basic things, but to start thinking about submodule management, when that always felt a little awkward, I was like, I'm like, that might, I think that might be a no for me.

And like, and I had to take a, like it wasn't until someone, we got far enough along down that path and as I was testing this out and with a couple people and I'm like, I just think this is gonna be too hard and it's gonna be a barrier for entry. So at it was at that point where I was like, I guess I need to kind of define my target user is going to be someone that's new, like a junior developer coming into this environment.

Like from step one, they install this thing and immediately they are like, Ooh, my environment just changed. I feel like I just made a big change and all I did was run some command line thing and I can start making some tweaks and pick a theme out. And I start using some aliases and I feel like a power user all of a sudden.

Let's cater to them. And when people can outgrow it and are advanced and can figure out they don't need it anymore, great. I, I assume most people would outgrow out on my Z show and do their own thing or find some other thing or just take [00:58:00] what they need. But then I hear from all these people like, oh, I just, it, the default's great.

I I don't need it. I see my theme show up in people's slides and I'm like, I don't know how many different, uh, demo videos I see for different products out there that are CLI related things and they're showing stuff and I'm like, that's my theme. It's just everywhere. And I'm

[00:58:18] **Charles:** Yeah. Yeah,

[00:58:19] **Robby Russell:** like, you could use other themes.

Um, 

[00:58:21] **Charles:** Please use other things, is what you're saying now, huh?

[00:58:24] **Robby Russell:** when it comes down to it, it's like, how easy is this gonna be for new people to, to be onboarded with this and thinking about their. That is my target user now, and it has been for many years. And like, let's let everybody feel like a super user day one, and then like, cool, I'm a hacker and you know, and, and then I can sell stickers and t-shirts to those people and that, that's fun.

So

[00:58:45] **Robbie:** I think that's, that's part of the key that like a lot of people don't think about, myself included, really, is like, you're just building a thing to build it, but you're not thinking about who is your user. And having that like user persona really helps you decide like what goes in and [00:59:00] what doesn't, because you're like, well, this doesn't benefit the user I'm trying to serve.

So it's not going in. And like, you know, I have that problem of like, I want to make everyone happy so everything goes in, like, you know, but, but then that's too complex and yeah, it doesn't serve everyone. So that, that, that's a good thing is like, figure out who you're actually, who your user is and like try to cater to them.

[00:59:21] **Charles:** that's strange. I've not had that experience with you. So, um, anyway,

on

the, uh, yeah,

there's a a touch

of that, which like takes us into lighter notes, I would

[00:59:33] **Robbie:** yeah, Speaking of what are you curious about?

[00:59:37] **Charles:** Robbie Russell. I'm very curious. If you weren't in tech, what other career would you choose?

[00:59:42] **Robby Russell:** I quit my last job officially 20 years ago this month to do Planet Organ full-time because I thought that I was going to be able to figure out how to be a starving musician.

So 

I, playing music has [01:00:00] and is one of my. Favorite things to do. I love collaborating with other people. It's also, I, I still very much involved in it now and have a band, and we're finishing up our fourth album right now.

Got to go on a short tour

last summer, which

[01:00:13] **Charles:** Is it grunge? I No, it's, it is not. We are a instrumental post rock art band, so if like, if you're explosions to the sky mwe

yeah. Yo, love mawa. I love Magu.

[01:00:25] **Robby Russell:** Yeah. So yeah, MWE is one of my, one of my favorite bands. And that's, that's a creative outlet that I've had for a long time and I. So that would be one thing. I used to think that I wanted to be a baker. I, what I knew I didn't want to do when I was a teenager was work in tech, or specifically at the time I called it the computer industry because my, I grew up in the Silicon Valley. My dad worked in hardware. He just recently retired.

He used to work at like hard drive manufacturing and networking companies and test engineer on real hardware and was always like, you should be a software programmer, since I was a little kid. And I was like, this is boring. I'm [01:01:00] gonna go outside and play with my friends. Um, because when you're, I love playing with computers and I've always used computers and love doing things with them, but it was never the thing that drew me.

I didn't, I, when I, the, the approach to like learning at a program when I, when it was introduced to me by my father was like him getting me a book when I was like six. And like, if you type all this stuff in this, on all these pages and this editor thing and you can run it, then you can play this game.

And I was like, but isn't the game already made? Can we, can I just play the game? Why do, I'm like, just. Typing everything. What I think was missing from the educational experience was, and then we'll modify it and then we'll make it, we'll personalize it, we'll, we'll make changes to it. Like that part wasn't really, like, we didn't really talk about that.

Like, let's build a thing to track my little league stats for my team. You know, like that would've been an interesting thing for me to problem, to solve. So I've, I've never been interested in the tech itself, just for the sake of doing it. It was always like, what can I do with it? And so the, the reason I even like learned to [01:02:00] start really getting into doing any web development in the late ni, you know, mid late nineties is 'cause I wanted to sell stickers and I had a mail order catalog thing that I was doing for like, in the punk music scene and I wanted to do stuff on the web.

And so I learned how to do some web stuff so people can submit a form online. So I'm like, how do I do that? I can't afford to pay someone. I'm like 17 and 18-year-old kid. I'll just figure how to like. I have a webpage that saves to like a text file or something on a server, and I can FTP and see that nobody ordered my stickers. uh, so like that's how I learned to start doing web stuff. And I pick up those skills over several years and, you know, you know, 25, 30 years later, and I now, because of some software I wrote, I sell stickers and t-shirts almost daily to people because they wanna support the project which is kind of funny.

So I've, I guess the other career, yeah, the career. I wish I either would've been love to be a musician or just like a DIY, like sticker sales person on the internet would've been exciting for me. Um, selling stickers for a couple dollars a pop 

[01:02:56] **Charles:** yeah. This sounds like a Robbie dream.

[01:02:58] **Robbie:** yeah. I, I would love to [01:03:00] like be a screen printer and sell shirts, but like, you know, or, uh, also music, you know, a lot of stuff there. I, I was in bands for years and then just like, it doesn't pay any money, so you can't do that. But like,

[01:03:11] **Robby Russell:** It's, it's an expensive hobby.

If you are listening and you like the bands that you listen to and you only stream them, feel free to pop over to their band camp site from time to time and buy the digital versions of it. Give 'em some money. Or maybe they'll even send you some vinyl or CDs or cassette tape in the mail.



[01:03:29] **Robbie:** Cassettes are cool again, so

yeah, 

[01:03:31] **Robby Russell:** have a cassette player.

[01:03:32] **Robbie:** I don't have anything that would play it either. Yeah.

Vinyl is of those for a little while,

you know, I feel like vinyl's cool again and like most people agree with that, but like Gen Z is like, cassettes are cool again. And I'm like, are they though? Like, I'm not sure, but.

[01:03:47] **Charles:** I had a car from 2000 for a little bit about, uh, while I bought it six years ago. And I had it for three years, four years, something like that. And, uh, I had a cassette player for the first two years. I really leaned in, [01:04:00] had a cassette player. I was like, I'm gonna get cassettes. You can buy 'em super cheap on eBay, go to the flea market, whatever else.

And I kind of leaned into that for a bit. So I didn't know they were cool. Now they are

inconvenient. 

[01:04:09] **Robbie:** I think they're cool. 

[01:04:11] **Robby Russell:** cool.

[01:04:11] **Robbie:** in a weird way. Like they're not, they're, they're not actually cool. I think we can most all of us agree that like, vinyl is cool because you can, like, you don't have to rewind it. You can just like start it over. Like, tapes were inconvenient. 'cause it's like,

[01:04:23] **Robby Russell:** it's like



[01:04:25] **Charles:** Have you ever played an eight track?

[01:04:26] **Robbie:** No, no. I, I have not, I've never had an

[01:04:29] **Charles:** because a tracks are like cassettes that you can't rewind. You literally have the separate tracks for the songs. And you're clicking through and wherever you left off last, that's where you go back to the song.

[01:04:40] **Robby Russell:** I

didn't remember that part of that. I only ever played with eight tracks at my, my grandfather's basement when he was a truck driver. And

I remember not

the same grandfather that was the, uh, the third, my other,

[01:04:55] **Robbie:** Hmm. Not Robert Russell. 

[01:04:57] **Robby Russell:** who also worked in tech. He worked at Atari [01:05:00] in the early

era of Atari

he was in.

So that was, that was an interesting thing to learn about

him when I

[01:05:06] **Robbie:** I actually never played with Ataris. I had in television, but never, never 

[01:05:10] **Charles:** Oh,

I had Atari 2,600 and I had Atari computer. That was the first time I ever did any programming. I don't know what it was, but I know my grandfather on my, uh, mother's side, he, he was a programmer for Proctor and Gamble.

We were in like northern Kentucky, Cincinnati area. So my grandfather there did work in computers, but it was like, I didn't know him that well and he gave me this notepad of things to type in. I thought that was cool. And then I forgot about it for 20 years. And then my dad was a welder, like blue collar, kind of whatever.

But he had a tracks, I don't know where I was going with this, but anyway, that's,

[01:05:46] **Robby Russell:** I remember finding, uh, in my gr my grandfather's eight track collection, there was like adult themed eight tracks apparently, that people would listen to while they were on, on the road. So if I didn't, that was a, that was an [01:06:00] experience that I, I was not expecting to retain all of my years. I should call him.

He's, he's, he's still around. He lives in, uh, Tennessee. I should like never, I've never asked him about that. I'm like, Hey, I once came across some very interesting, uh, hre in your basement, um, that, uh, you were a

[01:06:16] **Charles:** well those were in a closet you weren't supposed to get into. That's, that's the thing there. Yeah. The things I found in a closet in the basement were different.

[01:06:24] **Robbie:** yeah. Stack of vintage playboys.

[01:06:28] **Charles:** Yeah. Yeah. Vintage. Some even modern, possibly. Anyway. Well, you're not just Highfaluting Robbie. You got some Tennessee blood in 

[01:06:37] **Robby Russell:** I 

[01:06:37] **Robbie:** I, I, well, both of us. I didn't know who you were talking to there. 'cause my mom's whole family is from Tennessee.

[01:06:43] **Robby Russell:** Oh, really? Whereabouts? 

[01:06:45] **Robbie:** uh,

Kingsport mostly,

[01:06:47] **Robby Russell:** I don't know where that is.

[01:06:48] **Robbie:** big e big Eastman plant down there. Like, they, uh, I don't know what they even make. It smells like crap everywhere because whatever they're making is smelly.

Um. crap.

[01:07:00] No, like weird chemicals, I don't know.

Um,

but yeah, Kingsport and, uh, some in Knoxville, but not originally from Knoxville.

[01:07:08] **Charles:** I know a lot of people in Knoxville.

[01:07:10] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[01:07:10] **Robby Russell:** I just remember, uh, Lynchburg was like the town over. And so, 'cause that was a dry town and. Yeah, county, dry County. And my great-grandfather had f uh, like farmland in Tahoma, Hmm. which was like next to there. And I guess that's over near, what's the name of that music festival?

They have out that way? Every, it's like the, the big one. Um,

[01:07:34] **Robbie:** I don't know.

[01:07:36] **Charles:** I'm too old. I

[01:07:38] **Robbie:** do know that, uh, I think Kingsport was also a dry county. 'cause like my mom has told me about, my grandma would like. Cross cross, uh, county lines to buy like bourbon to make like a bourbon cake or something, and be like, worried like she's driving home, like,

[01:07:53] **Charles:** That's funny. Lynchburg is where Jack Daniels is their distillery. 

[01:07:58] **Robbie:** place 

to get a drink is what [01:08:00] they, they call their tagline, right?

[01:08:02] **Charles:** Yeah. 'cause you can't do tastings there and stuff, No,

[01:08:05] **Robby Russell:** I went there once when I was a kid. And what, what they would let you do is they would lift up like. Um, the top of like some crates or something and the smell would hit you. And so I don't know that that was, that was, that was like as close to like drinking as you could do there and then, um, but it's also being there, it was like there.

And what's the other sour mash whiskey there? Oh, Dickel. Um, and it was like from that area as well. 

that was my early entry into whiskey and whatnot.

[01:08:35] **Charles:** Oh, interesting. So you started from the Tennessee side, not just this, uh, weird scotch shit.

[01:08:41] **Robby Russell:** No,

[01:08:42] **Charles:** Proper scotch wish guy, right?

[01:08:45] **Robby Russell:** always. But always. Yeah. I would always be like Jack mixed with some soda or something and

I Yeah.

[01:08:52] **Robbie:** That's the classic. Yeah.

[01:08:54] **Charles:** Yeah. I did, uh, college. What, what college I did was, uh, always [01:09:00] Jim Beam and Coke.

[01:09:01] **Robbie:** Hmm. we were Evan 

Williams and

[01:09:03] **Charles:** still nicer.

[01:09:04] **Robbie:** ' cause it was a little cheaper.

[01:09:06] **Charles:** Dickel was cheaper. Interesting.

[01:09:09] **Robbie:** Mm-Hmm.

[01:09:10] **Charles:** I think 

[01:09:11] **Robbie:** Well, Evan Williams definitely was cheaper. I

[01:09:13] **Charles:** Oh yeah. Yeah. They're like, they're low tier. I still feel all of that is fancier than,

[01:09:19] **Robbie:** than What, what

[01:09:21] **Charles:** uh, I'm trying to think. Popoff, was the plastic anything in

[01:09:25] **Robbie:** does Popoff make Whiskey?

[01:09:26] **Charles:** bottle? No, but Popoff

is the vodka of, so what 

is the 

[01:09:31] **Robbie:** They pay you to take it? Yeah.

[01:09:32] **Charles:** No, they don't. They don't. But you are able to pull enough out of like a couch cushion to get it.

[01:09:38] **Robbie:** That's true, but then the next day everyone is dead.

[01:09:42] **Robby Russell:** dead. Yeah,

[01:09:43] **Robbie:** It's like full of like, everything you're not supposed to put in there is like all they put in there.

[01:09:49] **Charles:** for sure. Is that even legal anymore? Probably.

[01:09:53] **Robby Russell:** I always keep a nostalgic thing. I always have a bottle of rye dickel in our whiskey [01:10:00] cabinet. So it's, 

[01:10:02] **Charles:** I think it's decent. Yeah. I've got no, no 

[01:10:05] **Robbie:** They, they actually do a lot of cool collaborations. I'm forgetting with who right now, but I've seen a lot of them. So like they're, they're, yeah, they're not bad.

[01:10:14] **Robby Russell:** is that, is that also in a dry county? Do you know? I've not, I, I might go back and visit my grandparents who are still around, um, and living out that way, so I'm like realizing I should, I know they can't do tastings all the places, but anyway, 

[01:10:29] **Charles:** Yeah, the

The 

only, the only 10. Yeah, let us know. The only Tennessee one I know. Just 'cause we've been to the Greenbriar distillery, which is where Bellmead Bellmead was like their first big one, which was like sourced and whatever else. But now they have their own distillate out and Greenbrier and something else.

Are the two labels actually pretty decent

[01:10:50] **Robbie:** It is like Nelson, is it Nelson Brothers?

[01:10:52] **Charles:** Nelson Brothers. That's right. Yeah. Very good. See, you have not yeah, 

[01:10:57] **Robbie:** yeah. Their story was cool 'cause they were like, [01:11:00] you know, they went to the county where it started or whatever, and the like, historical Society had like two original bottles and like the like mash bill of how to make them. And they were like, oh my God, thank God we found you.

Like we want to give these to you so you can start this back up. And they were like, yeah, we do, like, we're gonna start that right now.

[01:11:18] **Charles:** yeah. The family was like, yeah, we're trying to figure this out. They got that. Yeah. Yeah. It's a great story.

[01:11:23] **Robbie:** yeah. I wish someone would, would do that for me, but they haven't so.

[01:11:27] **Robby Russell:** I was gonna say George Dickel is a brand of Tennessee whiskey produced in Toho and Coffee County. I feel like they should rename the county. I don't remember them. For their coffee. 

[01:11:37] **Robbie:** Yeah.

[01:11:38] **Charles:** bourbon County in uh, in Kentucky, the borders of that have changed, and most of the distilleries aren't in Bourbon County anymore. Anyway.

[01:11:47] **Robby Russell:** Is that going through a whole thing where like if it's not from Bourbon County, it can't be called bourbon, like

[01:11:51] **Charles:** It, no, that's not true. No, no, no. That's not true. It does have to 

be a us Yeah, it does have to be a US spirit because it's federally mandated and there's [01:12:00] like rules there. But you can make it in Colorado or Kentucky and it's still bourbon. Yeah. As long as you follow the rules, it comes outta the us. So it's not quite like, well, it's more like scotch.

'cause scotch has to come from Scotland.

[01:12:11] **Robby Russell:** Mm

[01:12:11] **Robbie:** Yeah,

[01:12:12] **Charles:** Otherwise it's Japanese whiskey, basically.

[01:12:14] **Robbie:** yeah.

[01:12:15] **Charles:** Or just single model American,

which better than

[01:12:18] **Robbie:** Japanese, 

[01:12:19] **Charles:** Do you really? Thus far? I, I

[01:12:22] **Robbie:** has no flavor. It's like water. I don't, I Um, yamazaki make of like 90 or not 90%. 90 proof thing tastes like water. But also I want some flavor. I just want flavor.

[01:12:36] **Charles:** Yamazaki 18. We gotta try that together because I've had it, I thought it was pretty good. I think it was like 20 14, 20 fifteens like. It was the first Japanese whiskey to get rated number one whiskey in the world at that time. And it was pretty good. And then it, all the prices got inflated.

[01:12:52] **Robbie:** Yeah, we are over time here. Uh, is there anything you want to plug or mention before we end?

[01:12:58] **Robby Russell:** so many things? Lemme pull up my list [01:13:00] here. My scroll. All right. Robbie Russell would be speaking at no. Um,

[01:13:05] **Charles:** I thought it was gonna be her album. That would've been

[01:13:08] **Robby Russell:** yeah, actually, you know what, uh, if you had to, my band is called The Mighty Missoula and it's named after the famous, like, I forget how many thousands of years ago floods that. Would, so there used to be this ma ancient glacier lake getting into geology nerd thing. Somewhere in like the Montana, Idaho region in the United States.

There used to be this huge glacier lake there and it would flood every so often. It would flood the whole Pacific Northwest. Like it was so massive that it carved out a lot of Pacific Northwest and the landscape. And so it would go all the way from like that area. It would flood like, I dunno if you're familiar with Oregon, but like the Willamette Valley, like where I live, like that's how far

[01:13:45] **Charles:** that's where the good pinot no wires Exactly. 

[01:13:47] **Robby Russell:** And so, so it's called the Missoula Floods, uh, is what that, that's called. So we called, we're named after that, which is a reference back to, um, another, [01:14:00] another post rock bands. Um, they have a song called the, the Mighty Rio Grande. And we named ourselves kind of, that's what we do as, as musicians.

We name ourself like naming things is always kind of like a, a derivative of something else. So anyways, the Mighty Missoula, we have our fourth album coming out later this year. Um, we are finishing up mixing that and, um, we'll be announcing, so if you look for the Mighty Missoula, maybe have those in the show notes.

But otherwise, my company's planet Argon Oma Zha is, oh, my Zha on the internet. I'm Robbie with a y, not IE and I'm the third. Um, but I don't usually say that online. uh, there's a really good episode of On the Maintainable podcast where I interviewed someone named Robbie Wagner. Robbie ve Wagner recently, which was recently published.

So thanks for coming on the 

[01:14:44] **Charles:** Oh, oh, you left me out of that. Oh, 

[01:14:48] **Robbie:** Yeah, because you weren't named Robbie. You were the third though. Yeah.

[01:14:51] **Robby Russell:** don't know how to interview two people at the same time, but May after doing this, I'm like, eh, maybe, maybe it's not so hard.

Um, Yeah. It's less structured for sure.

[01:14:59] **Charles:** Fair. [01:15:00] Fair enough.

[01:15:00] **Robby Russell:** The, uh, well, I guess it's, you're doing two hosts.

I have to, I need to, I need to figure, I get, I get, I get approached about this sometimes and I'm like, I don't know that I know how to do that yet.

then, yeah, fact, we make it up.

that's

[01:15:11] **Charles:** We don't know how to do anything.

[01:15:13] **Robby Russell:** so if you, if you're a user of all my zhe, um, we sell stickers in on the internet, and that always tickles me when I see stickers on people's laptops or come see, say hi to me at an upcoming conference.
